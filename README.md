# Classification Model using PySpark (Titanic Dataset)
In the first section of the peorject, the files has been uploaded from google drive and the project has been done using Google Colab 
This repository contains code for building a classification model using PySpark on the Titanic dataset. The goal of the project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

## Introduction

In this project, we use PySpark, a powerful framework for large-scale data processing, to build a classification model for the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, class, and whether the passenger survived or not. We aim to train a model that can predict survival outcomes based on these features.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project contains information about passengers onboard the Titanic. It includes features like:

- Passenger Class
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- Parents/Children Aboard
- Fare
- Port of Embarkation

The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) on Kaggle.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python, PySpark, and necessary dependencies. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the Titanic dataset from the provided Kaggle link and save it in the `data` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or any other environment that supports PySpark.
4. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, build the classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Building

The project involves the following steps for building the classification model:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and encoding the dataset to make it suitable for model training.
2. Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features for the classification task.
3. Model Training: Building a classification model using PySpark's MLlib.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
